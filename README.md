## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I'd like to add more food items for the user to choose from
* [ ] I'd like to give the user the ability to add food items to the database so they can add food they eat
* [ ] I'd also like to change the way date is inputted into the program. Typing out the entire date every time they want to do something is tedious.
